		A friend is like a star that twinkles and glows Or maybe like the ocean that gently flows. A friend is like an angel that is there to guide you.A friend is someone you can trust out of a few.A friend is more than one in a million.They are one in a ca-zillion,And you, my friend, are very special

		F.R.I.E.N.D.S: Fight for you. Respect you. Include you. Encourage you. Need you. Deserve you. Stand by you.Moons and years pass by and are gone forever, but a beautiful moment shimmers through life a ray of light.Life is a series of delicious moments. .The best way to pay for a lovely moment is to enjoy it. The most beautiful moments in life are moments when you are expressing your joy, not when you are seeking it.
